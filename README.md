# Flappy HVAC Simulation with Q-Learning


**‚ö†Ô∏èüë∑üößüèóÔ∏è WARNING** - This is a highly experimental hobby project!

## Simulation Overview

The simulation environment is inspired by `Flappy Bird`, with the goal of managing electrical power in an HVAC system powered by heat pumps. The objective is to maintain desired temperatures across multiple zones while minimizing power consumption and avoiding demand peaks (high kW usage). The heat loss calculations are completely made-up, with no connection to real-life physics‚Äîjust like how `Flappy Bird` doesn't worry about real-world aerodynamics or gravity. The experiment is a playful exploration to see if reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize HVAC systems. If RL shows promise here, maybe one day we'll dive into real-world physics for the HVAC system... but for now, it's just a "Flappy" Sim doing its best!
