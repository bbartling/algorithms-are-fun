# flappy-hvac
This is silly hobby project for experimenting with building electrical power management strategies through games and potentially something fun to try with reinforcement learning.

**⚠️👷🚧🏗️ WARNING** - This project is new and highly experimental! It may take some time to get something actually working...


This is a simple heat pump HVAC system simulation using `pygame`. The simulation manages multiple zones (rooms), each with its own heating needs, based on global outside air temperature.
